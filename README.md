## Features ✨

- **CPU Monitoring**: Real-time CPU usage and load average
- **Memory Stats**: Total, used, and free memory with percentage
- **Disk Space**: Disk usage with color-coded warnings
- **Process Tracking**: Top 5 CPU-consuming processes
- **System Info**: Hostname, uptime, and current date/time
- **Colorful Output**: Easy-to-read color-coded display

The dashboard displays real-time system information with color-coded output for easy monitoring.

- System hostname, uptime, and current date/time
- CPU usage (4.8%) and load averages
- Memory usage (3.0Gi used / 7.4Gi total - 41.0%)
- Disk space with color warnings (69% and 2% usage shown)
- Top 5 CPU-consuming processes

## Prerequisites 📋

- Linux operating system
- Bash shell (version 4.0 or higher)
- Standard utilities: `top`, `free`, `df`, `ps`, `awk`

## Installation 🚀

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/system-monitor-dashboard.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd system-monitor-dashboard
```

3. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x sysmonitor.sh
```

## Usage 💻

Run the monitor:
```bash
./sysmonitor.sh
```

### Auto-Refresh Mode (Optional)

To run the monitor with auto-refresh every 5 seconds, you can modify the script or run:
```bash
watch -n 5 ./sysmonitor.sh
```

## Configuration ⚙️

You can customize the script by editing the following:

- **Colors**: Modify the color codes at the top of the script
- **Disk Warning Thresholds**: Change the percentage values in `show_disk_info()` function
- **Number of Processes**: Modify the `head` count in `show_top_processes()` function

## Project Structure 📁
```
system-monitor-dashboard/
├── sysmonitor.sh       # Main monitoring script
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── LICENSE             # License file
```

## How It Works 🔧

The script uses standard Linux utilities:
- `top` - For CPU usage statistics
- `free` - For memory information
- `df` - For disk space usage
- `ps` - For process information
- `uptime` - For system uptime and load average

All data is formatted using `awk` and displayed with ANSI color codes for better readability.
